A super easy Japanese stir fry from Okinawa, goya chanpuru is full of bonito flakes, which is unique for a stir fry dish and so flavoursome that you will get addicted to it. Other than using pork slices instead of luncheon meat, I retained the original version by using only bitter melon, tofu and eggs. In a typical stir-fry, bitter melon is cut in half lengthwise, seeded, and sliced into thin C-shaped pieces. In this recipe, I use a different method that results in large pieces of the refreshingly bitter and cooling melon with each bite.

To prepare tofu, I like press the water out by placing the tofu block on a cutting. Bitter melon is different but good to stabilize blood sugar. I added ginger didn&#39;t have tomato and used &#34;patis&#34; instead of using shrimp. Boiled bitter melon first to remove some of the bitterness; used vegetable broth to simmer and marry flavors. Also added black bean garlic sauce.
