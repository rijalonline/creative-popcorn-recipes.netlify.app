recipeingredient:
- "4 Chicken breasts Boneless"
- "1/2 Cup All purpose flour"
- "1/2 Cup Cornstarch"
- "1 handful Cilantro Chopped finely"
- "2 Tsp Garlic powder"
- "2 Tsp Onion powder"
- "2 Tsp Red chilli powder Divided"
- "3/4 Breadcrumbs"
- "2 Eggs Beaten"
- "3-4 Tbsp Cooking oil I used Canola Oil"
- "1 Tbsp Butter"
- "1 Bunch Asparagus"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the chicken breasts thoroughly in a colander under running water. Shake off the excess water."
- "Butterfly the chicken breasts. (Cut open the chicken breasts) with the help of a sharp knife. Further, cut them into halves. Now, you have 4 thin strips from each chicken breast."
- "Note: Butterflying is a really useful technique to create a uniform thickness throughout a piece of meat, so that it will cook more quickly and evenly."
- "Combine the all purpose flour, cornstarch, 1 Teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon red chilli powder, onion powder &amp; garlic powder in a large plate."
- "Beat the eggs in a medium mixing bowl.   Place the bread crumbs in a dinner plate.  Add 1 teaspoon red chilli powder, 1 teaspoon salt &amp; the cilantro."
- "Dredge all the chicken breasts in the flour mixture at once.  Dip them one by one in the beaten egg. Roll in the breadcrumbs to coat well."
- "Heat oil in a large nonstick pan. Medium-high heat.   Cook the chicken breasts 5 minutes per side until golden &amp; crisp. Flip a few times.  When almost done, add the butter in the middle of the pan. Lift the pan &amp; do a swirling motion to spread the melted butter all over the pan. The butter at the end takes it to a few notches up. Total bliss!"
- "Serve immediately with steamed veggies of your choice. Asparagus, broccoli, beans, baby carrots, peas are some suggestions."
- "To steam the Asparagus:   Cut off about an inch of the hard stem &amp; discard. Cut into two or into small, bite size pieces, if you wish to. Wash thoroughly.   Heat water in a medium skillet/pan.  When the water comes to a rolling boil, turn the heat off."
- "Drop the asparagus in the hot water. Cover &amp; leave for 5-6 minutes. I love it crunchy."
- "Drain the water. Serve hot with a sprinkle of salt &amp; freshly milled pepper.   Enjoy!"
