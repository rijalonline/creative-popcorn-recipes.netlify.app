- "Add the bean sprouts and stir-fry sauce. Stir-fry briefly - about 1 minute, allowing the bean sprouts to stay crisp."

- "Place filling into wonton dough and roll shut. Use small amount of water to seal. Dried is better."
- "Continue rolling in this way until all the filling has been used up. As you work, place finished rolls on a plate and cover with a damp cloth to keep them from drying out."
- "Place 1 cup (or more) oil in a small frying pan over high heat. Oil should be about 1 inch deep. When oil starts to form thin moving lines across the bottom of the pan, turn down heat slightly."
- "Dip a corner of one egg roll into the oil. If it begins to sizzle/bubble and cook, the oil is ready. If nothing happens, allow oil to heat up a little longer."
- "When oil is ready, carefully slide egg rolls in, or place them in oil with tongs. Allow to cook 1 minute (or until golden brown) then use tongs to turn and cook the other side."
- "Place cooked egg rolls on a clean cloth or paper towel to drain."
- "Eat warm. Also good reheated so can be prepared in advanced."
