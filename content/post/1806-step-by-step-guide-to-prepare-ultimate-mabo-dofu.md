- "THIS IS NOT A STEP; if you feel that the ingredient list is way too long then just go with a basic mabo dofu recipe using just the ground meat, your choice of veggies and the dashi, soy sauce, sesame oil and salt. That&#39;s really all you need, everything else is just my preference, such as the habanero."
